## Welcome to BaseSec

Originally intended as a web-application scanner startup idea 

similar to startup mentioed by ramzi or another


and then pivot as the same for IoT, to apply for Startup Chile with my friend Oliver, back in 2013 - we failed - BaseSec is now "back" or actually "there" for the first time to summarize my experience in and views on security, and to a lesser extent privacy and GDPR.

My interest in IT security goes back to my high school days, long before I started to get into coding and web development, in 2015. In late 2014, I got the chance to participate in the Mach 37 accelerator at CIT in Herndon, Virgina, with Conatix. As a web developer, at Minodes, I took part in a workshop on applying GDPR in practice, and joined a training by Compass Security with the whole dev team on the OWASP 10. This made the foundation arguably somewhat solid, although I still feel like newbie in many things - since security is often only one aspect of my job as a web developer.
