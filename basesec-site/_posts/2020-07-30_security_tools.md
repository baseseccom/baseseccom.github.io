## Security Tools

Here goes the list, which might evolve over time:
- DNS66
- pihole project, unsuccessful setup
- uBlock Origin
- Malwarebytes
- yubikeys
- 1password - better than alternatives
- veracrypt
- wireshark, kali linux

Not much of an idea of security on Windows. Only touchpoint with that is following Ian Coldwater (?) on Twitter.

In general, security should be "practical", not perfect, and most of these tools are (comparatively) user friendly
