## Security opinions

Passwords:
- Strong password policies are stupid
- There is a lot to do wrong in the context of password resets,
allowing enumerating attacks

- Main spreader of malware
- there has to be a better way. Agree with DHH there.

2FA:

- SMS is a very insecure channel for it
- yubikey and auth apps like aegis

Insecure / bad apps:
- refuse the bad ones like discord
- minimize usage of zoom
