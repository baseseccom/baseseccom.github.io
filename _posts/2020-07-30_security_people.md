## Security People

Who I follow and want to pay close attention to in regards to security is not limited to famous people in the industry. To a large part, it is influenced by my time at Mach 37, and what gets shared on Twitter, Reddit and, to a lesser extent, Linkedin.

Here goes the list, which might evolve over time:
- Gary McGraw
- Troy Hunt - have I been pwnd
- Krebs on Security
- Felix von Leitner aka Fefe
- Sven Weizennegger
- Roman H(8200)
- Simon Tadros
- Roderick F.
- Toby D.
- Martin, my brother, developer of pwdhash
- Daniel, philosopher friend

The latter five do not publish on security, it is just my private discussion.
